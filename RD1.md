Reflection: 
 
I understood what I had to do but I didnt know the name of the commands that I needed. 
For example I had to search around on google to find os.path.is.file(filename) which bassicly checks if it exist, I needed this for error checking reasons. 

The easiest function I made was the read_movie_data file. It was pretty straight forward. Just open the file, read the data, make the data into a list. and return that list.

The hardest function would be the write_movie_data_with_profit function. I looked at similar projects online and had to see what they did for coding. For example, the csv.writer(file), I had no idea that existed untill I looked around online.
with header= data[0] + ["Profit"] adds a profit column to the row. This was also something new I found out that I could do.


I had so much trouble with the begginging. reading the data from the csv file. Without tutorials online and google I would be lost. There were times where it wasnt even reading the data correctly.
